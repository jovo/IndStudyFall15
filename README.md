# IndStudyFall15

## Schedule

We meet weekly at 4:30-6:00 on Wednesday, unless otherwise specified.
This means that you are expected to be there, at 4:30, with "homework" ready

## Homeworks

Each week when we meet, we will decide on "homework",
which means we will decide on some activity that we expect to take >= 10 hrs to complete.
the "definition of done" will typically be some quantitative "display",
such as a figure or a table with some accompanying legend.
you'll push code and resulting data derivatives and figures to repo,
such that i can reproduce them.


## Grading

Everyone starts with a 100%.
There are 12 weeks, so each week counts for for 8%.
Failing to show up for the weekly meeting results in a 2% deduction in grade.
Failing to >= 10 hrs of work in the week, as specified in the previous week, results in a 2% deduction in grade.
Add the end of the semester, I'll subtract deductions from 100% you will get whatever you get :)
